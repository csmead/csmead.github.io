If offices, contact with other human beings, and coffee breaks were still a thing, here's all the stuff I would talk to you about! Mostly fun facts from whatever book I happen to be reading. Very little to do with our actual job.

I link to Amazon in my [book reviews](/tags/reviews) because it's the most convenient way to share book details. I'm not an Amazon affiliate and I'm not getting paid for promoting any books.

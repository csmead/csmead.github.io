When I first joined Airbnb in 2017, I was eager to start a Christian Fellowship group with the local [Faith and Work Movement](https://www.faithandworkmovement.org/).

When trying to figure out what it should look like, I wanted it to be:
* Sustainable: This group should outlive me and not be dependent on any one personality.
* Formative: It should be teaching and training people how to integrate their work and faith.
* Outward focused: This group of Christians in the workplace should be primarily to serve our coworkers, not just an affinity group.
* Centering: It should remind us regularly that we are working for the Lord and not for man, and help to fight against the idols of work and success by centering us on Christ.
* Driven by prayer

So, we started simply by gathering together and praying. It was "freeform" prayer like you would usually find in a small group Bible study: go around the room,
share your prayer requests, and pray for whoever you felt like.

What we found was that, even though we _wanted_ to be praying for our coworkers and our company, we were only praying for ourselves. These simple prayer meetings
may have been sustainable, but they weren't really forming anyone and they definitely weren't outward focused.

I set about creating a "workplace liturgy": a written prayer that we would all participate in week after week after week. 
It would be structured to remind us to pray not just for ourselves, but for our coworkers, our company, and for the world.
It would serve as a model for

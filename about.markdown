Husband to [@oo0natalie0oo](https://twitter.com/oo0natalie0oo). Elder at First Presbyterian Church of San Francisco. SF Resident.

I build software for other engineers at Airbnb so they can be more productive at work, spend less time at work, and more time with their friends and families.

I read books on history (US, World, religious), theology, culture, philosophy, fictional empires that span the galaxy, and any intersection of those things.
